| Answer: | A3, B1, C2 |
| Objective: | 3.2 Describe features and tools in Azure for governance and compliance |
Rationale: | Resource locks can be used to prevent resources from being accidentally deleted or
changed. Even with rele-based access control policies in place there is still a risk that
people with the right level of access could delete a critical resource. Azure Resource
Manager locks prevent users from accidentally deleting or modifying a critical
resource, and can be applied to a subscription, a resource group, or a resource
Azure Blueprints provide a way to define a repeatable set of Azure resources. Azure
Blueprints enable development teams to rapidly provision and run new
environments, with the knowledge that they're in line with the organization's
compliance requirements. Teams can also provide Azure resources across several
subscriptions simultaneously, meaning they can achieve shorter development times
and quicker delivery.
Azure Policy is designed to help enforce standards and assess compliance across
your organization. Through its compliance dashboard, you can access an aggregated
view to help evaluate the overall state of the environment. You can drill down to a
per-resource, or per-policy level granularity. You can also use capabilities like bulk
remediation for existing resources and automatic remediation for new resources, to
resolve issues rapidly and effectively
